title: "New Job:"
description: "I am pleased to announce that I just started a new job. Over the next three years, I will be working as a data scientist and associate researcher in the research project SERIOUS led by Georg Lorenz. I will be investigating adolescents' social networks, how they relate to each other, and how this may affect social inequality. I am looking forward to the new challenge and to deepening my knowledge of social network analysis!"
