title: "New Paper out in Research in Social Stratification and Mobility"
description: "In a freshly published study, Georg Lorenz and I show how social influence between adolescents is influenced by social class boundaries: Friends whose parents have the same educational degree influence each other more in their educational aspirations than friends whose parents have different educational degrees, a phenomenon we call similarity bias. This similarity bias exists in face of a marked heterogeneity of relationships: adolescents have many diverse friendships with respect to parental education. Hence, de-segregation of schools, classrooms, and friendships may not be enough to reduce educational inequality.  On top of that, similarity bias needs to be better understood and reduced.
