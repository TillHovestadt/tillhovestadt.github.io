title: "New paper out in Zeitschrift für Erziehungswissenschaft: Can adolescents provide valid information on parents’ educational attainment in standardized surveys?"
description: "Together with Thorsten Schneider, I examined the quality of children's' responses regarding their parents' education. We find that, other than previously thought, these responses are not only often incorrect, but that this bias is also systematic: Children of immigrants, children of parents with lower education, and children with lower vocabulary skills misreport their parents' education significantly more often. We show that using children's responses in studies can lead to underestimations of educational inequality.
