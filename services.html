        Since 2015 I developed a portfolio of skills related to data analysis that I continously improve and expand. I offer consulting and solutions in the following areas:

        <h4>Data Collection</h4>
        <p align="justify">

          The basis of informed decisions and good research is collecting good and reliable data. I am expertly trained in survey methodology, approaching target populations, and experimental research. I can assist in identifying what it is exactly what you want to know, where to get the data from, and how to collect it.

        </p>


        <h4>Data Wrangling</h4>
        <p align="justify">

          Once data is collected, it needs to be cleaned, put into a format that can be read by statistical software, and stored securely. My skillset incoporates this and the treatment of missing data and invalid responses.

        </p>

        <h4>Data Analysis</h4>
        <p align="justify">

          The core of my work centers around analysing the collected data and applying state-of-the-art statistical methods appropriate to the questions and data at hand to it. I use these methods on the available data to receive answers to open questions.

        </p>

        <h4>Machine Learning</h4>
        <p align="justify">

          Although technically part of <i>Data Analysis</i>, Machine Learning has made a name of its own and describes techniques where algorithms infer patterns from the data and use this to answer open questions and predict patterns in the future.

        </p>

        <h4>Data Visualisation</h4>
        <p align="justify">

          A significant part of data analysis is to make sense of numbers and to visualise them in an understandable and clear manner. Good visualisations of the patterns uncovered in <i>Data Analysis</i>, and <i>Machine Learning</i> is integral to communications with other experts or the wider public.

        </p>

        <h4>Data Presentation</h4>
        <p align="justify">

          I have presented my research to the academic and non-academic public on many occasions. I learned to think of a story to tell with the data and how to deliver an effective presentation.
