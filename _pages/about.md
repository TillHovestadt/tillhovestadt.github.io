I am a research associate at the [Department of Sociology](https://www.sozphil.uni-leipzig.de/en/institute-of-sociology?duid=52&cHash=8c742c73e79e13bf97cb951b64efc0f0) at Leipzig University. Starting October 2024, I will pursue a DPhil in Sociology at [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/) and the [Department of Sociology](https://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/home) at the University of Oxford. I studied Sociology at Leipzig University and received a minor in Psychology from the University of Groningen.

My research revolves around inequalities with respect to socioeconomic status and social class. In my DPhil research, I investigate whether the friendships of students affect social inequalities in education. I am furthermore interested in social norms, social cohesion, and deviance.
