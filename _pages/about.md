I am a DPhil student in Sociology at [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/people/profiles/till-hovestadt/) and the [Department of Sociology](https://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/home) at the University of Oxford. I received a M.A. and a B.A. in Sociology from Leipzig University with a minor in Psychology from the University of Groningen.

In my DPhil project, I am researching two contemporary challenges to societies: segregation of social networks and social cohesion. I am interested in how societies, in face of stark segregation between social groups, manage to maintain social cohesion. A specific focus of my work lies on the segregation between social classes which I believe to be underrepresented in current sociological research. I am also interested in social norms, social influence, and deviance. You can download my full CV [here](https://github.com/TillHovestadt/CV/raw/main/CV_Hovestadt_EN.pdf).
